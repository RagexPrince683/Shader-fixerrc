# 3.2

* Fixed new Hbm's NTM gun rework with shaders
  - Now all bugs are DEFINITELY fixed (please)
* Added a setting to bypass the 30 fps limit in the main menu
* Fixed Dynamic Surroundings aurora with shaders
* Fixed Hardcore Ender Expansion with shaders
* Added mixin that disables mob rendering in LittleMaidMobEnhanced interaction GUI to fix shaders
* Fixed crash with RPLE and NEI
* Optimized code (performance improvements at the measurement error level)
* Added option for extended tooltips for dangerous items (hbm's ntm)
  - Asbestos/Coal dust items show how many "units" of dust they emit per tick
  - Explosive/Hydroactive items show the force of the explosion
  - Blinding/Pyrophoric items show for how many seconds they blind/ignite
    - If player has a tungsten reaches, then tooltip for pyrophoric items will be gray and crossed out

# 3.1

* Complete HBM's NTM fix
  * also improve some visuals with shaders

# 3.0

* Fix lighting bug in NEI
   - It also made it much brighter (side effect? actually using vanilla render so it looks like vanilla (and in vanilla it very bright))
   - Also optimize `renderMobSpawnOverlay` fix when using the original NEI


* Fix lighting bug in Schematica (full)


* Fixed a bug where the NEI overlay was causing some rendering to appear gray
    - For example: world tooltips, neat, schematica, etc.



* Fixed almost all bugs in HBM's NTM
  - some things related to weapons unfixed (since a rework is planned soon)
     - the hardest part is just ahead...
