* Fix lighting bug in NEI

   - Also optimize `renderMobSpawnOverlay` fix when using the original NEI


* Fix lighting bug in Schematica (full)


* Fixed a bug where the NEI overlay was causing some rendering to appear gray
    - For example: world tooltips, neat, schematica, etc.

     - the hardest part is just ahead...
