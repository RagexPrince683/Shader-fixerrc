* Fix lighting bug in NEI (or rather reduce it, since the brightness changes a little, but noticeably less)
   - It also made it much brighter (side effect? actually using vanilla render so it looks like vanilla (and in vanilla it very bright))
   - Also optimize `renderMobSpawnOverlay` fix when using the original NEI


* Fix lighting bug in Schematica (full)


* Fixed a bug where the NEI overlay was causing some rendering to appear gray
    - For example: world tooltips, neat, schematica, etc.
