# 3.2
### TODO

- [ ] Fix guns rotations or translations wrong
- [ ] Fix DANI wrong textures
- [ ] Fix aim animation choppy

- [ ] Find a way to have both space fork & main fixes (or just way until gun rework will be in sf)

# 3.1

* Complete HBM's NTM fix
  * also improve some visuals with shaders

# 3.0

* Fix lighting bug in NEI
   - It also made it much brighter (side effect? actually using vanilla render so it looks like vanilla (and in vanilla it very bright))
   - Also optimize `renderMobSpawnOverlay` fix when using the original NEI


* Fix lighting bug in Schematica (full)


* Fixed a bug where the NEI overlay was causing some rendering to appear gray
    - For example: world tooltips, neat, schematica, etc.



* Fixed almost all bugs in HBM's NTM
  - some things related to weapons unfixed (since a rework is planned soon)
     - the hardest part is just ahead...
