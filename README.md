# DISCLAIMER:

Although this mod is called "Shader FIXER", for the most part these "fixes" are just TEMPORARY solutions (aka workarounds) for problems that have NOT been found (and solved) in root yet

This mod isn't a magic solution for all shader problems, it only has explicit "fixes" for vanilla and mods listed above

Also, although this mod shouldn't cause serious problems even in the worst cases, but still, use at your own risk
